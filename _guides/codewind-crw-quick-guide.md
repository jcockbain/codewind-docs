## Overview

Use Eclipse Codewind to develop microservice applications from application stacks in an integrated developer environment (IDE). CodeReady Workspaces provides a containerized IDE for cloud-native application development on an OpenShift cluster. 

## Developing with CodeReady Workspaces 
CodeReady Workspaces uses Kubernetes and containers to provide a preconfigured environment. Use CodeReady Workspaces to create, build, and test your code in OpenShift containers but feel like you are working on an IDE on your local machine.  

### Prerequisite
Before you can use Codewind with CodeReady Workspaces, you must have an OpenShift cluster available. To install OpenShift clusters, see [CodeReady Containers](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/). 

CodeReady Workspaces require at least two 5Gi ReadWriteOnce (RWO) persistent volumes on the cluster to install and a 5Gi RWO volume for each created workspace.

Each Codewind workspace also requires at least one 5Gi ReadWriteMany (RWX) persistent volume.

### Installing CodeReady Workspaces
1\. Log in to your OpenShift cluster's dashboard. 

2\. From the sidebar, click **Operators** then **OperatorHub**.

3\. Search for `CodeReady Workspaces`. 

4\. Select **Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces**:

5\. Click **Install**: 

![Install CodeReady Workspaces](./images/codereadyworkspaces-images/CRW-Install.png){:width="800"}.

After you install the operator, continue to install CodeReady Workspaces:

1\. From the OpenShift dashboard, go to `Operators`>`Installed Operators`. 

2\. Select **CodeReady Workspaces**. 

3\. Select the **CodeReady Workspaces** cluster then **Create CheCluster**. 

4\. Configure the fields, like **tlsSupport**, as needed. 

5\. Copy and paste the following yaml into the provided text box: 

```yaml
apiVersion: org.eclipse.che/v1
kind: CheCluster
metadata:
  name: codeready-workspaces
spec:
  server:
    cheImageTag: ''
    cheFlavor: codeready
    devfileRegistryImage: ''
    pluginRegistryImage: ''
    tlsSupport: true
    selfSignedCert: true
    cheWorkspaceClusterRole: 'eclipse-codewind'
    customCheProperties:
      CHE_INFRA_KUBERNETES_WORKSPACE__START__TIMEOUT__MIN: "15"
      CHE_LIMITS_WORKSPACE_IDLE_TIMEOUT: "0"
      CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__BROKER_WAIT__TIMEOUT__MIN: "15"
  database:
    externalDb: false
    chePostgresHostName: ''
    chePostgresPort: ''
    chePostgresUser: ''
    chePostgresPassword: ''
    chePostgresDb: ''
  auth:
    openShiftoAuth: false
    identityProviderImage: ''
    externalIdentityProvider: false
    identityProviderURL: ''
    identityProviderRealm: ''
    identityProviderClientId: ''
  storage:
    pvcStrategy: per-workspace
    pvcClaimSize: 1Gi
    preCreateSubPaths: true
```

 ![Install CheCluster](./images/codereadyworkspaces-images/CRW-CheCluster.png){:width="900"}. 

  * **Note:** If you install CodeReady Workspaces on an OpenShift cluster with publicly signed certificates, such as on IBM Cloud, set **selfSignedCert** to **false**. 
  
6\. After CodeReady Workspaces installs, click the **CodeReady Workspaces URL**.

7\. A new window appears that prompts you to log in. If you have not made a CodeReady Workspaces account, do so by clicking **Register**:

![Register an account](./images/codereadyworkspaces-images/CRW-Register.png){:width="900"}. 

8\. After you make a CodeReady Workspaces account, you can start to create a Codewind workspace. 

### Setting up Codewind
Because of its dependency on `buildah`, Codewind needs to run as root and privileged. To enable Codewind, run the following commands from your command line: 
  * `oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccounts:<namespace where you installed CodeReady Workspaces>:che-workspace` 
  * `oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccounts:<namespace where you installed CodeReady Workspaces>:che-workspace` 

CodeReady Workspaces starts Codewind and installs the Codewind plug-ins. This process might take a couple of minutes for all of the necessary components to be pulled and started.

### Creating the Codewind workspace
After you set up Codewind, log in to your CodeReady Workspaces account and create a Codewind workspace from the Codewind devfile: 

1\. Log in to CodeReady Workspaces. 

2\. Go to **Workspaces** then click **Add Workspace**. 

3\. Click **Import Devfile**. 

4\. From **Source**, click **YAML**. 

5\. Go to the link, [codewind-che-plugin/0.13.0/devfile.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/0.13.0/devfiles/0.13.0/devfile.yaml), then copy and paste the contents into the YAML text box in your Codewind workspace. 

6\. Click **Create & Open**.
