# Getting Started - different configurations for Codewind

Codewind can be used in one of three ways - locally, [hosted](./che-installinfo.html) as an application on a cloud, or remotely. 


## Using Codewind Locally

## Using Codewind as a hosted application on the cloud via a browser

## Using Codewind remotely

By using Codewind remotely, you can develop your code locally, but build and run your application in the cloud. Remote use of Codewind frees up your desktop resources, using the cloud's resources to build and run applications. 





### Next Steps

Select [Connecting your VS Code to remote Codewind](remotedeploy-vscode.html) or [Connecting your Eclipse to remote codewind](./remotedeploy-eclipse.html) to configure your IDE to connect to Codewind in the cloud.
